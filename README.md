# String attractors

These scripts were created as software support of my bachelor thesis [String attractors](https://vercah.github.io/veronika-hendrychova/bachelor-thesis.pdf). Some of the algorithms are described in the third chapter.

The main programs that can be run from commandline are `check_attractor.py`, `antipal_attractor`, `antipal_closure`, `bwt.py`, `check_attractor.py`, `get_rote.py`, `get_sized_attr.py`,
`get_smallest_attr.py`, `pal_attractor.py`, `pal_closure.py`, `pseudostd_closure`, `rote_sturmian_comparison.py`.

You can always run `<script> -h`, which should print out understandable explanation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- the `itertools` library
